<h1>About My Journey</h1>
<p>
I’m a Computer Science student and self-taught MERN Stack Developer focused on
building scalable, user-friendly web applications.

I have built and deployed multiple full-stack projects using React, Node.js,
Express, and MongoDB, gaining hands-on experience with authentication, REST APIs,
and modern UI design.

Currently, I’m strengthening my fundamentals and actively seeking internship
or junior developer opportunities to grow professionally.
